## Introduction

The duty scheduler module is an integral part of the Hospital Management System, designed to streamline the process of assigning shifts to medical professionals and staff members. It aims to optimize the distribution of duties and ensure a fair workload among the workforce.

This repository contains the source code and necessary files for the duty scheduler module. It includes the implementation of the scheduling algorithms, database connectivity, and a user interface for managing duty assignments.

## Features

The duty scheduler module offers the following features:

- **Shift Management:** The system allows the creation, modification, and deletion of different types of shifts based on department, time slots, and priority.
- **Employee Management:** It enables the addition, modification, and removal of medical professionals and staff members within the system.
- **Duty Assignment:** The scheduler automatically assigns shifts to available employees based on predefined rules and constraints, taking into account factors such as employee preferences, qualifications, and workload.
- **Schedule Optimization:** The module continually optimizes the duty assignments to ensure equitable distribution of workload, minimize conflicts, and maximize employee satisfaction.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** The system generates reports and provides analytics on duty assignments, employee availability, and other relevant metrics.

## Installation

To set up the duty scheduler module locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/thowfeeksalim/hospital-management.git
Navigate to the duty directory:

shell
Copy code
cd hospital-management/duty
Install the required dependencies. You may use pip (Python package manager) to install the necessary packages:

shell
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database connection. Modify the configuration file (config.py) to provide the appropriate database connection details, such as hostname, username, password, and database name.

Run the application using a Python interpreter:

shell
Copy code
python app.py
Access the duty scheduler module by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Usage
Once the duty scheduler module is running, you can use the web-based interface to manage shifts, employees, and duty assignments. The intuitive user interface provides options for adding, modifying, and deleting shifts and employees, as well as viewing duty assignments and generating reports.

Make sure to configure the duty scheduling rules and constraints based on your hospital's requirements. You may need to modify the scheduling algorithms and business logic to fit your specific needs.
